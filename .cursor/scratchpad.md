# Chat App Project - Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

Building a React-based frontend-only chat application with the following key features:
- Username and room-based chat system
- Local storage for message persistence
- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI
- Functional React components with hooks
- No backend required - pure frontend solution

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **State Management**: Need to manage user state (username, current room) and message state across components
2. **Local Storage**: Implement proper storage/retrieval of messages grouped by room
3. **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between JoinForm, Chat, and Message components
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-friendly interface with proper CSS/styling
5. **Message Formatting**: Proper timestamp display and message structure

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React project with Create React App
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Components Development
- [ ] Create App.js with routing logic
- [ ] Implement JoinForm.js component
- [ ] Create Chat.js component with message handling
- [ ] Build Message.js component for individual messages

### Phase 3: Local Storage Implementation
- [ ] Implement localStorage utilities for message persistence
- [ ] Add room-based message grouping
- [ ] Handle message storage and retrieval

### Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancement
- [ ] Add responsive CSS styling

- [ ] Add "Clear Chat" functionality
- [ ] Ensure proper timestamp formatting

### Phase 5: Testing and Polish
- [ ] Test all functionality across different scenarios
- [ ] Verify localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Final code review and cleanup
